<h2><strong>&nbsp;My comments about the piece&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;To me, the outline helps a lot in the structure and gives a organized plot of how to write a blog about the topic I gave, Does pure friendship exist between opposite gender.</p>
<p>But, there is one tiny thing that I think it shall improve ---- I would like to have some sort of direction for searching data to create ethos.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
